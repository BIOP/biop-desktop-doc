# Welcome to the "**BIOP-desktop documentation**" repository.

The goal of this repository is to create [**github pages** documentating the BIOP-desktop](https://biop.github.io/biop-desktop-doc/) project.

The **BIOP-desktop** is a docker image that contains a set of bioimage analysis software, and a desktop environment to run them.

All the Dockerfiles and companion files are available in the [**BIOP-desktop repository**](https://github.com/BIOP/BIOP-desktop).
